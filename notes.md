### System prompt
The "system prompt", for most AI APIs, is a special prompt that goes at the beginning of the conversation that carries more weight than a typical user prompt.

The system prompt sets the tone for the conversation, and can be used to:

- Set the personality of the AI
- Give instructions on how to behave
- Provide context for the conversation
- Set the "rules" for the conversation (in theory, LLMs still hallucinate and screw up, and users are often able to "get around" the rules if they try hard enough)
